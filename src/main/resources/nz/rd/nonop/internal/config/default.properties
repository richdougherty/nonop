# Default properties used by nonop. In usual agent usage these are loaded then overridden by any system properties
# that have been set.

# This is the property that users usually override; by default match everything not included. A user may wish to set
# a rule which includes only their project files, for example.
nonop.scan=* // by default match anything not excluded by builtin

# This is a set of packages which a user would usually wish to exclude. These are matched before the user's nonop.scan
# setting. The builtin scan rules can be overridden with a property as well, if needed.
